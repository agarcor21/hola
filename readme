1) Gene dropping

Calculate identities by using gene dropping (just for checking)

Compile   :  > gfortran dropping.f90 -o dropping
Usage     :  > dropping filename i1 i2  (i1 and i2 are the individuals to be processed)
Example   :  > dropping mencha.txt 19 22

2) Tabular method

Calculate identities by using tabular methods (3D and 4D tables)

Compile   :  > gfortran tabular.f90 -o tabular
Usage     :  > tabular filename i1 i2  (i1 and i2 are the individuals to be processed)
Example   :  > tabular mencha.txt 19 22

The 15 identities are sorted as in Karigl's paper

3) Recursive function

Calculate identities by using recursive functions as described in the paper

Compile   :  > gfortran recursive.f90 -o recursive
Usage     :  > recursive filename i1 i2  (i1 and i2 are the individuals to be processed)
Example   :  > recursive mencha.txt 19 22

The 15 identities are sorted lexicographically
